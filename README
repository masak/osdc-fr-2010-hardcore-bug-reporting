This is a talk I gave on 2010-10-10.

BooK was happy to see the presentation software I used, so here it is for
public use and tinkering.

There's a generated PDF in the "Downloads" section. If you want to generate
your own slides, I suggest you try generating the slides. (Font sizes have
been known to vary across platforms.)

$ ./make-presentation

Some CPAN modules as well as Inkscape are required. If you're on a non-Mac,
you'll have to do something about the hard-coded Inkscape path at the end
of the script.
